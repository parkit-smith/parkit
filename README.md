## Guide to Editing for the Web Developer

## Guide to Basic Editing
The page files may look scary at first, but editing them is simple! In this short guide, we'll address some of the most common edits and how to do them!

## But First: Where/How Do You Edit?
Our project repository is hosted on a website called [Github](https://github.com). Log in using the following credentials:
    username: parkit
    password: parkitsmith
You'll get to our repository homepage, and you'll see a list of all of our project files. Click on the one you want to edit. Then, in the top-right corner, there is an 'Edit' button, which looks like a pen. Click that and you can edit. 

After you are done editing, scroll down and you'll see the 'Commit' and 'Commit Message' boxes. These boxes are where you can name the change you made, and write a brief description of what you changed respectively. Please do not skip this as it helps us track who has changed what, especially if the website gets broken!

After you have filled out the Commit boxes, press the green Commit button, and you are done!

### Design Changes
    Design changes generally require some familiarity with the structure and syntax of HTML and CSS. If you feel confident enough in your understanding of the structure of the webpage, feel free to make minor design changes. However, if you are at all unsure, contact Laura and she will see if what you want is possible!
